## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

**Framework & Build System:**
- React 18 with TypeScript for type-safe component development
- Vite as the build tool and development server for fast HMR and optimized production builds
- Wouter for lightweight client-side routing without React Router overhead
- Single-page application (SPA) architecture with static file serving in production

**UI Component System:**
- Shadcn/ui components built on Radix UI primitives for accessible, customizable components
- Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling with custom design tokens
- Glass morphism design language with futuristic aesthetic (neon blue accents, dark theme)
- Responsive layouts supporting mobile-first design patterns

**State Management:**
- TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management, caching, and data synchronization
- Local component state with React hooks for UI interactions
- Form state handled by React Hook Form with Zod schema validation

**Design System:**
- Custom color palette: Neon blue primary (#00D9FF), black/white/metallic neutrals
- Typography: Modern sans-serif fonts (Inter, Poppins) via Google Fonts
- Spacing based on Tailwind's 4px unit system
- Theme provider supporting dark/light modes with localStorage persistence

**Key Features:**
- Interactive product configurator with real-time price calculation
- Multi-step forms with validation for orders and quote requests
- File upload support for custom designs (SVG, DXF, PDF formats)
- Responsive image galleries with category filtering
- Admin dashboard for managing products, materials, orders, and inquiries

### Backend Architecture

**Server Framework:**
- Express.js for HTTP server and RESTful API routing
- TypeScript for end-to-end type safety
- Custom middleware for JSON parsing, logging, and request tracking

**API Design:**
- RESTful endpoints organized by resource (products, materials, orders, inquiries, testimonials, contacts)
- CRUD operations for all primary entities
- Validation using Zod schemas shared between client and server
- JSON response format with consistent error handling

**Data Layer:**
- Storage abstraction interface (IStorage) defining all database operations
- In-memory implementation for development/prototyping
- Designed for future PostgreSQL integration via Drizzle ORM
- Schema-first approach with TypeScript types derived from Drizzle schema definitions

**Database Schema (Planned PostgreSQL):**
- **Products:** Catalog items with categories (home-decor, 3d-signs, corporate, gifts), base pricing, images
- **Materials:** Available cutting materials (Acrylic, MDF, Wood, Metal) with per-unit pricing and thickness options
- **Orders:** Customer orders with product configuration, material selection, dimensions, custom text, design files, status tracking
- **Inquiries:** Quote requests for custom projects
- **Testimonials:** Customer reviews with featured/non-featured flag
- **Contact Messages:** Customer support and inquiry messages
- **Users:** Admin authentication (planned)

**File Handling:**
- Design file uploads stored with URL references in database
- Support for vector formats: SVG, DXF, PDF

### Development & Build Pipeline

**Development Mode:**
- Vite dev server with HMR for instant client updates
- TSX execution for server-side TypeScript without compilation step
- Concurrent client/server development with single command
- Replit-specific plugins for runtime error overlay and development banners

**Production Build:**
- Vite builds optimized static assets to `dist/public`
- ESBuild bundles server code to `dist/index.js` as ESM
- Static file serving through Express in production
- Single deployment artifact containing both client and server

**Type Safety:**
- Shared schema definitions between client and server in `shared/` directory
- Path aliases (@, @shared, @assets) for clean imports
- Strict TypeScript configuration with no implicit any
